Linux identifies disks as devices, typically named /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc. For example:

    /dev/sda → First hard drive
    /dev/sdb → Second hard drive

2. What is a File System? 🗃️

A file system is the method Linux uses to store and organize files on a disk. It defines how data is written and retrieved. Some common file systems in Linux are:

    ext4 📂 (most common)
    NTFS (used by Windows)
    FAT32 (older file system)
    XFS 🗂️ (used in enterprise systems)

Each file system has its own structure for managing files and directories, with specific rules about file naming, permissions, and how the files are stored.

3. Mounting a File System 🛠️

Before using a disk or a partition, you need to mount it into the Linux file system. Mounting means connecting the file system of a disk or partition to a directory so it can be accessed.

For example:

    The root file system (/) is mounted on the first disk, usually /dev/sda1.
    You can mount other disks (like /dev/sdb1) to directories like /mnt or /media.

Command to mount:

"
> sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
"

This mounts the partition /dev/sdb1 to the /mnt directory, making it accessible.


4. Directory Structure 🌳

Linux uses a tree structure for its file system, starting from the root directory /. Some important directories include:

    /bin 🏃: Essential system programs (e.g., ls, cp)
    /home 🏡: User data (e.g., /home/user1)
    /etc ⚙️: Configuration files
    /var 📊: Variable data (log files, databases)
    /mnt 🛠️: Mount point for temporary storage devices


6. Disk Partitioning ⚙️

Partitioning is dividing a physical disk into sections so each section can hold a file system. You can partition a disk to organize data better and prevent one file system from affecting another.

To check your partitions, you can use the "fdisk" or "lsblk" (ls block) command:


7. Checking Disk Space 📊

To check disk usage, you can use the df (disk free) command:

"
> df -h
"

This shows the disk space usage for each mounted file system in a human-readable format (e.g., GB, MB).

Example Workflow 🏃‍♂️:

    Plug in an external disk. It appears as /dev/sdb1.
    Mount the disk to /mnt:

"
> sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
"

You can now access the files on that disk under /mnt.
To unmount the disk:

"
> sudo umount /mnt
"

| Type              | Source | Speed     | Measures                     |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| Cached Reads 🔄   | RAM    | Very fast | Memory/cache performance     |
| Buffered Reads 📀 | Disk   | Slower    | Actual disk read performance |
