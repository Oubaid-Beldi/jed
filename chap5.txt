** command "<sudo> mkfs -t(type) <type> <disk>" **

-b taille block
-c check bad blocks
-i octes/inodes
-m reserved % for the root (default 5%)
-L label
-j journal
------- vFAT only:
-F taille vFAT
-I auth usage of entire disk
-n nom disk vFAT
-v afficher les details

This command erases all data on <disk>. It reformats the partition with a new <type> file system.

** command "<sudo> tune2fs -j(journal) <disk>" **
tune2fs -O ^has_journal <disk>
Tool to adjust tunable parameters of ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems
A journal improves reliability and crash recovery.
‚ö†Ô∏è Before using this:
    Make sure /dev/sdb6 is not mounted (or mounted read-only).

** command "e2label <disk>" or "sudo e2label <disk> <label>" **

Tool to view or set the label (name) of an ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem
A label makes it easier to identify or mount partitions by name (instead of device path)

‚ö†Ô∏è Before using this:
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Works only on ext2/ext3/ext4 file systems
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Label must be 16 characters or fewer
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ You can mount with: mount -L <label> /mnt

** command "mount <device> <mount_point>" **

mount -t type -o [ro,rw] periph point_mont
-U <uuid> mount using uuid

sudo mount -o option1,option2,... <device> <mount_point>
| Option | Meaning                    |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| `ro`   | Mount read-only            |
| `rw`   | Mount read-write (default) |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `(no)user`  | Allow a **normal user** to mount the device |
| `auto` | mount again auto         |
| `noauto` | --              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `noexec` | Prevent running executables          |
| `exec`   | Allow execution (default)            |
| `nosuid` | Ignore set-user-ID or set-group-ID   |
| `suid`   | Allow suid/guid programs (default)   |
| `nodev`  | Ignore device files                  |
| `dev`    | Allow device files (default on root) |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `sync`     | Writes are done immediately (slower, safer) |
| `async`    | Writes are cached (default, faster)         |
| remount | if already mount |



Tool to attach (mount) a file system (like a partition, USB drive, or ISO) to a specific directory in the Linux file system tree

üìå After mounting, the contents of the device become accessible at the mount point
Example:

sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt

‚û°Ô∏è Mounts the partition /dev/sdb1 to the /mnt directory

‚ö†Ô∏è Before using this:
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The mount point must exist (create it with mkdir if needed)
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The device must contain a valid file system
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ May require sudo for permission
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ To mount by label: mount -L <label> /mnt
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ To view current mounts: mount or findmnt

** command "df" or "df -h" **

Tool to display disk space usage of mounted file systems

üßæ Shows:

    Total size, used and available space
    Mount point (where the file system is attached)
    Device name (e.g. /dev/sda1)

‚úÖ Commonly used options:

    -h: Human-readable (shows sizes in MB/GB)

** command "du" or "du -h" **

Tool to estimate disk space usage of files and directories

üßæ Shows how much space is used by a directory and its contents

‚úÖ Commonly used options:

    -m: Megabytes
    -h: Human-readable (KB, MB, GB)
    -s: Summary (just the total for the directory)
    -a: Show all files and directories
    --max-depth=N: Limit depth of displayed subdirectories

** command "sudo fsck <device>" **

Tool to check and repair consistency errors in a Linux file system
(stands for: File System ChecK)

üõ†Ô∏è It scans for:

    Corrupted inodes
    Lost or bad blocks
    Incorrect file links
    Unclean shutdown effects

‚úÖ Common usage:

sudo fsck /dev/sdb1
‚û°Ô∏è Checks the file system on /dev/sdb1

‚ö†Ô∏è Before using this:

    NEVER run fsck on a mounted file system (can cause damage)
    Boot into recovery mode or use umount first
    Automatically fixes issues with -y:

** command "sudo tune2fs -C <count> <disk>" ‚Üí e.g. sudo tune2fs -C 1000 /dev/sdb6 **

Tool to manually set the mount count of an ext2/ext3/ext4 file system

üõ†Ô∏è Used to simulate frequent usage or force a file system check on next boot
‚úÖ What it does:

    -C 1000: sets the mount count to 1000
    When the mount count reaches or exceeds the max mount count (e.g. 30), fsck will auto-run during boot
    Good for testing or forcing fsck
