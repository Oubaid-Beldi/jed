** command "grep -i <pattern>" **

Tool to search for text patterns in files or output
The -i option means: ignore case (uppercase/lowercase doesn't matter)

🔍 So:

grep -i "linux" file.txt

Will match: linux, Linux, LINUX, etc.

⚠️ Notes:
    Without -i, grep is case-sensitive
    You can combine it with other options like -r (recursive) or -n (line number)

🧪 Example:

dmesg | grep -i error

➡️ Finds all lines in system logs that contain “error” (any case)

** command "sort -n" **

Tool to sort lines of text numerically (by number, not alphabetically)

🔢 Normally, sort treats values as text, so:

sort file.txt

Would sort: 1, 10, 2 ➡️ wrong order
But:

sort -n file.txt

Sorts: 1, 2, 10 ✅ correct numerical order
