Chap 3: Gestion droit d'access

👤 User Types:

    Owner (user): the person who created the file.
    Group: a group of users who share access.
    Others: everyone else.

🔐 Permission Types:

    r (read): Can view the contents.
    w (write): Can modify the contents.
    x (execute): Can run the file (if it's a program or script) or access the directory.

> ls -l script.sh
> -rwxr-xr-- 1 alice devs 1234 May 10 12:00 script.sh

This means:

    -: It's a file (not a directory). if its a directory you see "d"
    rwx: The owner (alice) can read, write, and execute.
    r-x: The group (devs) can read and execute, but not write.
    r--: Others can only read the file.

🔧 Changing Permissions:

You can use chmod, chown, and chgrp.

1. Octal (numeric) notation — e.g., chmod 755 file.txt
Each permission is represented by a number:
_______________________
| Permission  | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| `r` (read)  | 4     |
| `w` (write) | 2     |
| `x` (exec)  | 1     |
| `-` (none)  | 0     |

2. Symbolic notation — e.g., chmod u+x file.txt

This method uses letters and symbols:
    u = user (owner)
    g = group
    o = others
    a = all (or you can leave it empty)
And:
    + = add permission
    - = remove permission
    = = set exactly

Change owner:
> chown bob script.sh

Change group:
> chgrp admins script.sh

What is umask?

The umask (user file creation mask) is a system setting that controls the default permissions given to newly created files and directories. It essentially masks (removes) certain permissions from the default permissions when creating files or directorie

How umask Works:

The umask value is subtracted from these default values to determine the final permissions for a new file or directory.

For example:

    If umask is 0022, it means the system will remove write permissions for the group and others when creating files or directories.

        For files: Default permissions = 666, umask = 0022 → Resulting permissions = 644 (rw-r--r--)

        For directories: Default permissions = 777, umask = 0022 → Resulting permissions = 755 (rwxr-xr-x)

How to read umask:

    umask value: 022
        User (owner): 0 (no permission masked)
        Group: 2 (write permission removed)
        Others: 2 (write permission removed)

How to Calculate the Mask (umask):

    Default permissions:
        For files: 666 → (rw-rw-rw-)
        For directories: 777 → (rwxrwxrwx)

    Desired permissions:
        For files: 761 → (rwx rw- --x)
        For directories: 761 → (rwx rw- --x)

    To get the umask:
        Subtract the desired permissions from the default permissions.

    For files (using 777 as the default):

        Desired: 761 → rwx rw- --x
        Subtracting 761 from 777:
            777 - 761 = 0016

        -> So the umask is 0016.
